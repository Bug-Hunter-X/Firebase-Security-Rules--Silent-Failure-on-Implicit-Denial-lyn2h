The solution involves adding explicit checks within the security rules to handle cases where the `user_id` field might be missing or the data node doesn't exist.

```javascript
// Improved Security Rules (firebase.rules)

match /databases/{database}/instances/{instance}/path/to/data/{id} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && (get(/databases/$(database)/instances/$(instance)/path/to/data/$(id)).data.user_id == request.auth.uid || !data.exists());
}

```

This improved rule ensures that the data exists, handles potential null values in the data structure, and allows access only when the authenticated user's UID is equal to the `user_id`  or if the data does not exist.  Adding a more comprehensive error handling mechanism on the client-side can also improve debugging.  For example, catching Firebase errors using `.catch()` would help identify rule-related issues explicitly.
